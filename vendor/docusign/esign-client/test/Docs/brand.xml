Hello [[Data:RecipientName]],

A payment gateway account that you connected to your DocuSign account has become disconnected. DocuSign can no longer process payment transactions using that payment gateway account. If you intended to disconnect that payment gateway account, no action is necessary. Any envelopes or templates with payment requests using that payment gateway account cannot be completed unless you remove the payment request or edit it to use a different payment gateway account.

For instructions on how to reconnect your disconnected payment gateway account, see Reconnecting a disconnected payment gateway account.
